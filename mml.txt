MML format as used in Î¼Script:
------------------------------

A - G    Plays the notes corresponding to the notes A-G on the musical
         scale. A # or + after the note makes it sharp, and a - makes
         it flat.

1-64     Optional suffix to note to override duration for that one note.

Ln       Sets the duration of the notes that follow. n is a number from
         1 to 64. 1 is a whole note, 2 is a half note, 4 is a quarter
         note, 8 is an eighth note, etc.

On       Sets the current octave. There are 7 octaves, 0 through 6. The
         default octave is 4. Each octave starts with C and ends with B.
         Octave 3 starts with middle C.

Nn       Plays a note. n is in the range 0 to 84. Instead of specifying
         the note's letter and octave, you may specify the note's number.
         Note zero is a rest.

Pn       Plays a rest (if that's the right terminology). n is the same as
         for the L command, but specifies the length of the rest.

.        Plays the note as a dotted note. You music buffs know that means
         that the note is one half it's length longer when dotted. Place
         the dot after the note, not before it. More than one dot may be
         used after a note, and dots may be specified for rests.

MN       "Music Normal." Each note plays 7/8 of the duration set by the
         L command.

ML       "Music Legato." Each note plays the full duration as set by the
         L command.

MS       "Music Staccato." Each note plays 3/4 of the duration set by the
         L command.
